# vee-validate-redberry-interns

I created this application as a guidline for Redberry interns.
There are two maind forms in this app: 'form' and 'formYup'.

- form - is validated using global rules that are imported from @vee-validate/rules. and in the example its easy to understand how to make custom rules
- formYup - is validated by vee-validate form schema & Yup validation package
